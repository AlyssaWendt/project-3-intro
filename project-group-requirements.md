# Project 3: Group Option

A group project option is available for those interested in tackling a project with a larger scope and collaboration challenges.

You will be building a full-stack MERN application, with de-coupled React front-end and Express back-end.

For those interested in tackling a Group Project, please have your list of teammates and an agreed-upon app idea ready prior to project approvals.

Please note that the increased scope of a full-stack application will come with added difficulty and scoping challenges, as your group will need to implement two applications in the span of one week.
