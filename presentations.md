## Requirements

- Length: 5-7 minutes (with 1-2 minutes for QA) - Max length 10 minutes
- Topics covered (see below)
- Delivered to section groups
- Students are encouraged to utilize props / visual aids / slide-decks / GH documentation to format and structure your presentation. 

Note: Your peers will certainly enjoy hearing about triumphs and set-backs in your code. But, wait! Rather than scrolling through your text editor, consider including key pieces of code in your documentation and only highlight what is absolutely essential and unique to your project. 

## Presentation Formatting:

### Introduction

- What's your app called?
- Why is it useful? What is your "elevator pitch"?

### The Planning Process

- How did you arrive at this idea?
- What would you change about your planning process?

### Demonstrating Your App

- What are the integral features of your app?

### Demonstrating Your Code

- What was the most difficult part?
- What did you learn?
- What are you most proud of?

### Highs and Lows

- What worked well?
- What didn't?
- What features would you like to add?

## Project 3 Submissions

When your deliverable is ready, submit (or update) your issue on the Project 3 issues tab with the links to your deployed application, your GH repo, and any presentation aids.
